- CAB settings
- dir: Users\Jeong\CAB\test

# week1
## 2021-01-25

## Task1
1. prepare settings (for windows)
- install "anaconda" 
- install "visual studio code"
- install "git"

2. prepare directory (at github & laptop)
- create repository "test" on github ("/username_on_github/test.git" ; "git link")
- create a directory on laptop ("C:\Users\test")

3. Authentification (to allow access from laptop to repo at github)
- Press *"control + R"* to open cmd prompt
- go to the directory on laptop
```
cd "C:\Users\test"
```
- clone (copy and paste) the repo from github to laptop

```
    git clone "git link"
```
or
```
    git init
    git remote add origin "git link"
    git config user.name "__"
    git config user.email "__"
    git clone "git link"
```

4. open directory on visual studio code
- click the directory (where you cloned repo)

## Task2
- assignments (first 5): https://dsft.code-data-ai.com/python-workshops/

- install python extension in VisualStudioCode, e.g. markdown preview


## 2021-01-26
Todo:
- data types, operators

> spike
- what is programming: a set of instructions to communicate with the system
- what is variable: object that can vary. 
  - e.g. "var = 5" : "var" is assigned to "5" 
  - Left Hand Side (LHS) is assigned by Right Hand Side(RHS); LHS is not constant but is varying. 

- data type, operators
	- integer division operator
	- numeric, boolean, list, strings, tuple
	- assignment (=), comparison between values (==)

- variable(object)s in python: https://www.golinuxcloud.com/python-type-of-variable/

## 2021-01-27
Todo:
- loops, conditionals, functions
- understand basic concepts (e.g. list, set, dict, tuple, string, int, float, boolean) (conditions & loops) (functions)
- assignments (week1-int-3&4)

> spike: loops & functions
- set is an unordered list and does not allow duplicates. (> key to assignments)
- loops
	- when you use while loop, be careful to have 'if - break'
	- using "if  + elif + else " is more efficient than using "if + if + if"
- functions 
	- ask 'specific task/instructions' (for this, we need to assign "values" to "variables")
	- returns/print a value (for this, we need to have "return" in the end of function)
	- elements : arguments -> formula/functions -> output
    - e.g.
    ```python  
    # function with one argument
    def sample(x): 
        print (['Input is ' + x ]

    sample('name')

    # function with two arguments    
    def sample(x, y): 
        output = (x+y)*2
	    return output

    # if default value for "y" is assigned in the function, this function will work even when you only entered one argument
    def sample2(x, y=0): 
        output = (x+y)*2
	    return output
    ```
