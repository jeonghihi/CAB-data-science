  - situation: last week, lots of complaints from registered bike riders: non-availability of bikes 
  - Also, I do not want to get such complaints from Casual Users. Hence, how could analytics team help me in preventing this happening to Casual Users.
  - Since past, I have seen in Rainy days, we do not make much profits for obvious reasons. Can you provide us a statistics about contribution of weather in bike demands.
  - I believe, pollution and traffic would have some effect on sales. Can we have any investigation into that.
