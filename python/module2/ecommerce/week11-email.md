# Subject: A report on ecommerce market (amazon.com) in electronic categories

Hi Mark,

First of all, sorry for the late reply. We have encountered with the critical issues while establishing the database by collecting the information from the website and recently solved the issue. 

Currently we are analyzing the data, and below I listed the on-going analysis plans based on your question/inquiries in your previous emails. 

Hope you find these information useful to expect which infomation will be included in the report later. 

# Situation/Goal: 
- provide a report on ecommerce market (amazon) for electronic product categories

## Task1:
- provide a brief statistics/overview of ecommerce market (amazon.com)
    ### Action: 
    - analyze the basic statistics (e.g., ratings, review count, price) in each category
    ### Results:
    - table with visual bar chart for each category

## Task2: 
- analyze the sales pattern of products in each 8 category.
    ### Action: 
    1) find top 3 selling products in each product category based on customer ratings nr (+ seller rank?)
    2) find the most reviewed products based on the number of rating/reviews
    3) suggest critical factors influencing the customer's decision, e.g. ratings (e.g. 4.4/5), review nr (e.g. 2000 vs. 500 customers)

    ### Results:
    1) analysis on the average ratings (and median ratings) for each category.
    2) explain why some category have better rating than others.
    3) provide a list of top 3 selling products and top 3 reviewed products, with visual information (e.g. bar plots) 

## Task3: 
- explain the feature (i.e. cons and pros) and importance of customer reviews 
- check the current status of top selling products (if any of them is discontinued and possible reasons)
- how to promote potential purchases of customers' related to their target products
    ### Action:
    1) find top 3 brands with highest ratings in each category 
    2) regarding the importance of customer reviews, explain what to consider from customer review/ratings for the sales analysis.
    2.2) provide an example of customer reviews of top 3 rated products 
    2.3) provide a solution for dealing with positive/negative reviews
    3) find out in which category customers tend to buy multiple products related to their target product. 
    ### Results:
    1) visual graph

    2) Following the Amazon's description, verified reviews are more reliable than unverified ones because unverified ones did not use amazon marketplace. Thus we consider the verified reviews more important in general, but we analyze the status of products/markets based on the number of ratings from both review types because customers on amazon website will see the total number of reviews including both types. 
    However, when it comes to the predicting the influence of reviews on other customers' buying decision, it would be more accurate to consider rating values only based on the verified reviews. 
    Furthermore, if possible, we would analyze the detailed contents of each reviews to check whether the rating values are highly related to the feature of words appearing in the reviews; e.g., reviews wth high ratings might contain more positive words describing high satisfaction with the product, in terms of price/durability (e.g., very good, nice, happy, worth it, will buy again, recommend) and words describing if the actual product is same/similar to the description/customer's expectation (e.g., exactly, same). 
    Also, top reviews, which appear on the top position of review sections, tend to have a large number of people finding them helpful, and we can first check what are the frequent words appearing in those top reviews to analyze the strength/weakness of the products. [customer satisfaction score][1] 

        - This is a table where you can see pros and cons of top 3 rated products based on customer reviews 
        (a table with total 24 rows; 3 for each product type)

        - The proportion of positive/negative reviews on the products in each category changes as shown below.
        (fig: the change of numbers of both review types on time-series graph)

    3) This a list of products that are bought together with a target product is as shown below (e.g. showing how more / less frequent is 'the sales of headphones and laptops' as compared to 'the sales of laptops and DLSRs').
    Based on this, we suggest you to strengthen the recommendation services in XX categories to facilitate the customers' purchases for relevant products.


## Task4:
- provide a comparative analysis to design sales COMBO offer.
    ### Action:
    - We will provide a list of main product features that play a significant roles in customer statisfaction. (per each category)
    ### Results:
    - This infomation can be provided after analyzing the detailed reviews.



Thank you again for your patience and feel free to ask me if you have any questions.
I will come back to you with the updated results and the analysis on actual sales data. 

Best,
Jay
