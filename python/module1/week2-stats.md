- Q1: Given, there are 5 numbers in the data set: (8, 12, 16, 24, 4). What will be the sum of deviations of individual data points from their mean ?
> A1: Zero.

- Q2: If some outliers are introduced to the dataset, what will happen to the Standard Deviation ?  
  - A) Standard Deviation is robust to outliers 
  - B) Standard Deviation will increase with the introduction of outliers. 
  - C) Standard Deviation will decrease with the introduction of outliers. 
  - D) Can not be determined.  
> A2: B
> 
> - Standard deviation is a square root of variance.
> - Variance is a sum of squares of differences between all numbers in the data and their mean.
> - Standard deviation measures the extent to which data varies from the mean.


- Q3: Suppose the below positively skewed distribution has a median of 30, which of the following statement is true?
  - A) Mean is greater than 30
  - B) Mean is less than 30
  - C) Mode is greater than 30
  - D) Mode is less than 30
  - E) Both A and D
  - F) Both B and C

> A3: E
> - A positively skewed distribution is a result of unequal distribution of values in given data. In this distribution, the mean is usually greater than the median because a few values(datapoints) tend to shift the mean to the right and these datapoints would be considered as outliers. (=> Mean > Median =30 > Mode)

4. Which value can be the possible value for the median of the below distribution?
    - A) 40
    - B) 26
    - C) 16
    - D) 50
> A4: B


5. What is the shape of the distribution ?
> A5: positively skewed distribution


6. What would you consider to be the most appropriate measure of the center for this data?
> A6: median


7. If Y axis represents the number of individuals and X axis â€“ salary of the individual in thousands. How many individuals have salary less than 10 thousands ?
> A7: (maybe) 35 (the height of bars is not clear)


8. We have a set of positive numbers. If a single value of the set is altered what must change ? 
    - A) Mean 
    - B) Median 
    - C) Mode 
    - D) All of these
> A8: A (not D)


9. The chart shows hourly consultancy rate of 10 people. Calculate the standard deviation of the salaries of the 10 employees.
> A9: 9.0138

```python
##A1 - mistakes (ignored the number of employees)

##A2 - after Arun's answer
import numpy as np
dataset=[25,25,25,40,40,35,50,50,50,50]
np.mean(dataset) #mean: 39
np.std(dataset) #stdev: 10.4403


# A3 - using package math
dataset=[25,25,25,40,40,35,50,50,50,50]

def variance(data, ddof=0):
  n = len(data)
  mean = sum(data) / n
  return sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / (n - ddof)

def stdev(data):
  import math
  var = variance(data)
  std_dev = math.sqrt(var)
  return std_dev

variance(dataset)
stdev(dataset)

# A3.1 - calculating mean, deviation without packages
salary = np.array([25, 40, 35, 50])
employee_nr = np.array([3,2,1,4])

for number in range(len(salary)):
  i = number
  n = employee_nr[i]
  print (n)

  val = np.repeat(number, n))

data = [25,25,25,40,40,35,50,50,50,50]

# sample : calculating standard deviation from a list 'a'

    n=len(a)
    m=sum(a)/len(a)
    d=[e-m for e in a] # deviations from mean
    v=0
    for e in d:
        v+=e**2
    return (v/n)**.5

std(data)


total_sum = sum(salary*employee_nr) #sum of salary of all employees

10.   Which of the following random variables is discrete?

A) the length of time a battery lasts
B) the number of pens purchased by a student in a year
C) the percentage of cows in a cattle firm that have been vaccinated
D) the distance between a pair of towns
> A10: B
> - "discrete variable": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable


11.   Which of the below normal distributions will have the greatest spread? ( mu = mean, sigma = stdev)
     - A) mu=5,  sigma =1.5
     - B) mu=10, sigma =1.0
     - C) mu=5,  sigma =1.65
     - D) mu=8,  sigma =1.2
     - E) mu=10, sigma =1.6
> A11: E (or it changes depending on the population of given dataset)

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 

# apply same codes for A-E
mu = 10 #mean
sigma = 1.6 #stddev
sample = 100
np.random.seed(0)
sample_E = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, sample).astype(int)

def sample(a,b):
  mu = a
  sigma = b
  sample = 100
  np.random.seed(0)
  sample = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, sample).astype(int)
  return sample

sample_A = sample(5, 1.5)
sample_B = sample(10, 1.0)
sample_C = sample(5, 1.65)
sample_D = sample(8, 1.2)
sample_E = sample(10, 1.6)

# draw histogram
data_all = pd.DataFrame({'sample_A': sample_A,'sample_B': sample_B,'sample_C': sample_C, 'sample_D': sample_D, 'sample_E': sample_E})
data_all.hist()

## when one unit in sigma increase
```


12.  For a normal distribution with mu=10 & sigma =1.4, about 2.5% of the values lie above what value? (Assume that the number is above the mean value) ( mu = mean, sigma = stdev)
> A12 : 2 (2 sigma)


### additional info
- how to calculate standard deviation: 
  - calculate the mean > calculate the variance > calculate the square root of the variance
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    val = np.array([8, 12, 16, 24, 4])
    np.mean(val)

    def std(a): 
        n=len(a)
        m=sum(a)/len(a)
        d=[e-m for e in a] # deviations from mean
        v=0
        for e in d:
            v+=e**2
        return (v/n)**.5

    std(val)

    ```
