- Q1: Given, there are 5 numbers in the data set: (8, 12, 16, 24, 4). What will be the sum of deviations of individual data points from their mean ?
> A1: Zero.

- Q2: If some outliers are introduced to the dataset, what will happen to the Standard Deviation ?  
  - A) Standard Deviation is robust to outliers 
  - B) Standard Deviation will increase with the introduction of outliers. 
  - C) Standard Deviation will decrease with the introduction of outliers. 
  - D) Can not be determined.  
> A2: B
> 
> - Standard deviation is a square root of variance.
> - Variance is a sum of squares of differences between all numbers in the data and their mean.
> - Standard deviation measures the extent to which data varies from the mean.


- Q3: Suppose the below positively skewed distribution has a median of 30, which of the following statement is true?
  - A) Mean is greater than 30
  - B) Mean is less than 30
  - C) Mode is greater than 30
  - D) Mode is less than 30
  - E) Both A and D
  - F) Both B and C

> A3: A
> - A positively skewed distribution is a result of unequal distribution of values in given data. In this distribution, the mean is usually greater than the median because a few values(datapoints) tend to shift the mean to the right and these datapoints would be considered as outliers.

1. Which value can be the possible value for the median of the below distribution?
    - A) 40
    - B) 26
    - C) 16
    - D) 50
> A4: B

5. What is the shape of the distribution ?
> A5: positively skewed distribution

6. What would you consider to be the most appropriate measure of the center for this data?
> A6: median

7. If Y axis represents the number of individuals and X axis â€“ salary of the individual in thousands. How many individuals have salary less than 10 thousands ?
> A7: (maybe) 35 (the height of bars is not clear)

8. We have a set of positive numbers. If a single value of the set is altered what must change ? 
    - A) Mean 
    - B) Median 
    - C) Mode 
    - D) All of these
> A8: D

9. The chart shows hourly consultancy rate of 10 people. Calculate the standard deviation of the salaries of the 10 employees.
> A9

10.  Which of the following random variables is discrete?

A) the length of time a battery lasts
B) the number of pens purchased by a student in a year
C) the percentage of cows in a cattle firm that have been vaccinated
D) the distance between a pair of towns
> A10: B
> - "discrete variable": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable

11.  Which of the below normal distributions will have the greatest spread? ( mu = mean, sigma = stdev)
     - A) mu=5,  sigma =1.5
     - B) mu=10, sigma =1.0
     - C) mu=5,  sigma =1.65
     - D) mu=8,  sigma =1.2
     - E) mu=10, sigma =1.6
> A11: E (or it changes depending on the population of given dataset)

```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 

# apply same codes for A-E
mu = 10 #mean
sigma = 1.6 #stddev
sample = 100
np.random.seed(0)
sample_E = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, sample).astype(int)

# draw histogram
data_all = pd.DataFrame({'sample_A': sample_A,'sample_B': sample_B,'sample_C': sample_C, 'sample_D': sample_D, 'sample_E': height_E})
data_all.hist()
```

12. For a normal distribution with mu=10 & sigma =1.4, about 2.5% of the values lie above what value? (Assume that the number is above the mean value) ( mu = mean, sigma = stdev)
> A12 : 2 (2 sigma)


### additional info
- how to calculate standard deviation: 
  - calculate the mean > calculate the variance > calculate the square root of the variance
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    val = np.array([8, 12, 16, 24, 4])
    np.mean(val)

    def std(a): 
        n=len(a)
        m=sum(a)/len(a)
        d=[e-m for e in a] # deviations from mean
        v=0
        for e in d:
            v+=e**2
        return (v/n)**.5

    std(val)

    ```
