- implementation: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/02/logistic-regression-concise-technical-overview.html

# task1 - train the data and evaluate the logistic regression model

# Task2 - calculate Kappa and check how it differs from Accuracy . The evaluation of a model should contain both accuracy and kappa.

# Task3 - choose any 2 out of these algorithms (k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine) and try to do the same steps you did with Logistic Regression.
- my choice: k-nearest neighbors and random forest (one of the most accurate learning algorithm), and try SVM if possible

```python
#code ing: in wine_ml_logistic_regression.py
