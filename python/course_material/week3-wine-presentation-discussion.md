# story for presentation on 2021-02-12
- background
- goal : we want to tell them what is the good wine
- dataset
- analysis plan : we want to show how to find the good wine (3questions)
> Which factor or combination of factors affect the quality of red & white wines > correlation
> Do the diffrent types of wines have different factors affecting quality? > regression graph showing how three factors influence quality differently (volatile acidity, citric acid, alcohol)
> Is there any other intresting trends that exist in other columns besides quality? > next step : maschine learning

- exploratory results: 5-6plots 
1) what is the tendency of variables in the red and white wine (bar charts)
2) proportion of quality label in red and white wine: (pie charts : 2 plots) 
3) correlation between all variables for red & white (correlation matrix for red and white : 2plots)
4) how three factors influences the quality (regression plots : 3 plots) (bar graph)

- end: next step 


# story for the final presentation
## page1
- background: personal story - when you enter the supermarket/wine shop, you want to find a good wine or delicious one that you used to drink / red or white / dry or sweet
- question: so company wants to make a good wine

## page2: answer: we can tell you - fisrt we explored the data and these three points are our results:
plot1) Q1 - important factors for the quality of red & white: volatile acidity, citric acid, alcohol

plot2) Q2 -these three factors influence red and white wine differently
> two variable (acidity) influence the quality of red stronger than the quality of white wine
> one variable (alcohol) influence the quality of red and white wine similarly

## page3 : answer 3
plot3) Q3 -which factor should have higher / less proportion for red & white wine
> based on postivie / negative correlation (only show highly significnat factors)

## page 4 : suggestion (goal) 
- so based on these findings, we can tell you how to make a great wine: more acidic, less XX

## page 5 : plan
- next step: with the limisted resource, how can they find a trade off point to produce & sell everything.  a few good quality ? or many low quality (sold at medium price) ?
e.g. correlation between factors 
e.g. stack bar for proportion of acidity in red vs. white

> solutions with a pH less than 7 are acidic > so most wines (with phH between 2.9-3.9) are acidic //if we are presenting one of acidity variable, we do not need to explain about pH
> how can we describe the effect of Density on quality/price tag
